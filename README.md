# ReactJS-states-and-reusability-potential

- The sample code shows a simple way to use states in React
- CDNs have been used for convenience
- Different buttons are used to increment the value of a single state counter
- The code has been made more reusable in the subsequent branches keeping the same functionality
- You can check the changes in the branches or pull requests in this repository
- The first branch makes the increment function reusable by binding values to the same function at runtime
- The second one makes the Button component reusable by making it stateless and passes values as props. This reusability is evident in the alert button added. Also, this time values are defined in default props and overridden in RenderDOM.render method
- And the final one shows the same functionality in ES6 syntax
